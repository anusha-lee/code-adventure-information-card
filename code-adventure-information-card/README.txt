# Code Adventure Information Card

Create an information card in this fun Code Adventure. We've provided a mockup
for you to follow, or if you're up to the challenge, create your own layout and
styles. Feel free to add whatever you'd like to this information card - whether
it is HTML, CSS, or JavaScript functionality. 

## Getting started 

  
1. Review the mockup.png file 
  - This mockup is for those who want a visual representation to follow along 
    with. You are more than welcome to add your own styling and layout.
  
2. Review the images inside of the images folder
  - These are some starter images from what I used in the mockup. Feel free to add
    your own images for this awesome adventure.
  
2. Open up index.html file
  - There's some HTML stater code for you to start off with. Go ahead and add the
    HTML for the information card here.

3. Open the style.css file inside the css folder
  - Add your styles to this file to make this information card look sweet. I went 
    ahead and linked the stylesheet to the HTML.  
  
  
## Tasks

- Add HTML elements to the index.html file
  
- Style your information card by adding CSS to the style.css file
  
  
### Take this project further

If you want to do even more, here are a couple of ideas to expand on this code 
adventure
- Add a CSS hover effect when the information card is hovered over
- Add a CSS transition effect with hover effect
- Add JavaScript functionality to the information card
  - Ex. Add a next arrow. when the arrow is clicked, replace the current members 
   information with a new member
